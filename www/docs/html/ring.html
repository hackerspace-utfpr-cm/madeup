<h3>Variables</h3>

<p class="grayblock">In the last lesson, we designed a decagon with the help of a <code>repeat</code> loop:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0
repeat 10
  move 2
  yaw 36
end
dowel</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (repeat (INTEGER 10) (block (call move (INTEGER 2)) (call yaw (INTEGER 36)))) (call-with-names dowel))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">Those were good days, when we built that shape. But now, we decide that we want the ring to be thicker.</p>
