<h3>Star</h3>

<p class="grayblock">In this lesson, we'll walk a star-shaped path and extend it into the scene with the <code>extrude</code> solidifier.</p>

<p class="grayblock">Before jumping into code, do the following to get a feel for our task:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Draw the outline of a five-pointed star on a piece of paper.</li>
  <li>Put your finger on one of the inner corners or vertices.</li>
  <li>Imagine you are sitting in a car (or on a bicycle) at that vertex.</li>
  <li>Start driving along the edge. What can you say about the turns you are making?</li>
</ol>

<p class="grayblock">You should see that driving around a star is a little like driving around a circle. What's different is that on some steps we turn left, while on others we turn right. This alternation creates the five pointed arms.</p>

<p class="grayblock">Let's recreate that driving experience in Madeup. We start by positioning ourselves at the origin and walking up the first arm:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

move 10</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (call move (INTEGER 10)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">Let's take a right and walk the other side of the arm. But how many degrees should we turn? There's not one right answer here. Let's use 122 for the time being:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

move 10
yaw 122
move 10</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER 122)) (call move (INTEGER 10)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">At this point we are almost ready to walk the next arm. But we need to do something first. What is that something?</p>

<p class="grayblock">We need to turn left to get pointed along the next arm. But by how much?</p>

<p class="grayblock">We know that we'll need to travel a full 360 degrees to get back where we started, and we have five arms to do it in. That means each arm will have to effectively turn 360 / 5 = 72 degrees. We've already turned 122 degrees. 122 plus what is 72?</p>

<p class="grayblock">Exactly. We must turn -50 degrees:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

move 10
yaw 122
move 10
yaw -50</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER 122)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER -50)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">To get the next arm, we could copy and paste. But that would be silly. This is a job for <code>repeat</code>:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

repeat 1
  move 10
  yaw 122
  move 10
  yaw -50
end</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (repeat (INTEGER 1) (block (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER 122)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER -50)))))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">Increase the repeat count to 2 to see the next arm. Then 3. Then 4. And finally 5. I always recommend testing loops incrementally like this. If you jump straight to 5, it's hard to reason about what the loop is doing.</p>

<p class="grayblock">Now we're ready to solidify this. You could use <code>dowel</code> to make a cookie cutter. But let's check out the <code>extrude</code> solidifier, which interprets our path as the cross section of solid shape and extends it along some direction. Let's extend it along the Z axis, which is (0, 0, 1). We also need to tell <code>extrude</code> how far to extend the cross section. Let's go with 6:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

repeat 5
  move 10
  yaw 122
  move 10
  yaw -50
end

extrude 0, 0, 1, 6</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (repeat (INTEGER 5) (block (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER 122)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER -50)))) (call extrude (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 1) (INTEGER 6)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">How's that? Rotate the model to see its thickness.</p>

<p class="grayblock">Try tweaking the degrees you turn to change the pointiness of the star.</p>

<p class="grayblock">If you change one of the turn numbers, you also have to change the other because the two turns must add up to 72. In general, we can say that <code>rightTurn + leftTurn = 72</code>. Given this mandatory relationship, wouldn't it be nice if we could just pick the right turn amount and have the left turn automatically calculated? We can do this using a <em>variable</em>.</p>

<p class="grayblock">We start by creating a variable for the right turn amount. We'll call it <code>angle</code>. We assign <code>angle</code> the value 144, and then we turn by <code>angle</code> instead of 122:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

angle = 144
repeat 5
  move 10
  yaw angle
  move 10
  yaw -50
end

extrude 0, 0, 1, 6</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (define-variable angle (INTEGER 144)) (repeat (INTEGER 5) (block (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (call-with-names angle)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (INTEGER -50)))) (call extrude (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 1) (INTEGER 6)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">Then we calculate the left turn with a little arithmetic using <code>angle</code> instead of some hardcoded amount:</p>

<p class="grayblock"><div class="mup-switcher">
  <div class="text-editor">moveto 0, 0, 0

angle = 144
repeat 5
  move 10
  yaw angle
  move 10
  yaw 72 - angle
end

extrude 0, 0, 1, 6</div>
  <div class="block-editor"><div class="s-expression">(block (call moveto (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0)) (define-variable angle (INTEGER 144)) (repeat (INTEGER 5) (block (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (call-with-names angle)) (call move (INTEGER 10)) (call yaw (- (INTEGER 72) (call-with-names angle))))) (call extrude (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 0) (INTEGER 1) (INTEGER 6)))
</div></div>
</div>
</p>

<p class="grayblock">Now if we change <code>angle</code>, the left turn will be computed automatically to ensure that a star is born.</p>
