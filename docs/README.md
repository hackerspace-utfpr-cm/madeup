#Madeup
Madeup is a programming language for generating 3D models. It is a language for makings things *up*. Its speakers use commands like `move` and `yaw` to walk through space along the cross sections or skeletons of solid models. They then use commands like `extrude` or `revolve` to generate a solid model. The models can then be printed or imported in another 3D application.

Like any language, Madeup has a grammar and meaning that must be learned in order to express models. This document describes the language so that you can start making things up.
